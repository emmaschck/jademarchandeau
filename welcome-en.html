        <p>Jade Marchandeau, a video artist and
illustrator, was born in Paris in 1995. 
        </p>
        <p>She studied at the
Institut Sup√©rieur des Arts de Toulouse (ISDAT) before
pursuing her graduate studies at the Bezalel Academy of Art
and Design (Tel Aviv, Israel-Palestine), where she graduated with a
91/100 average. 
        </p>
        <p>Jade's work focuses on her personal life,
relationships and experiences. She often incorporates
images of her family and friends, while questioning her
identity through a fragmented editing technique and the
use of voice-over. In this way, she emphasizes the
symbolic or philosophical significance of her images. In
addition, she pays particular attention to the elements of
everyday life that are often considered insignificant. In this
way, she claims the personal story as a catalyst of the
common history and as a mirror of our present society.
